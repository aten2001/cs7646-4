Code Run Steps
- To generate Indicator plots run  'python indicators.py'.
  This will generate plots for SMA, Bollinger Bands, Momentum and On Balance Volume indicators.
- To run theoretically optimal strategy on in sample data, run 'python TheoreticallyOptimalStrategy.py'
    This will also generate the comparison plot with benchmark.
- To run manual strategy on both in sample and out sample data, run 'python ManualStrategy.py'. This will
   generate comparison plots with benchmark for both in sample and out sample data.
